# iOS-Developer-and-Designer-Interview-Questions

A small guide to help those looking to hire a developer or designer for iOS work. While tailored for iOS, many questions could be used for Android developers or designers as well. A great self-test if you're looking to keep current or practice for your own interview. 

Inspired by the wonderful [Front-end Job Interview Questions](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions), I've done my best to match their format and have pulled some of their best questions for inclusion here. Pull requests and suggestions to this repository are highly encouraged.
